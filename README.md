# plant-info-app
Small app created to house information on each owned plant.

## Version 0.0
### Ideas
The current idea is have a landing page that has some sort of title banner that says "plants" or something. <br>
Possibly have a color scheme selector at the top in the form of a drop down.

Under the banner, a drop down menu for each plant in collection, and a submit button under that. <br>
Once the submit button is hit, the page will render information on the selected plant. <br>
This information could include: <br>
<em>
the name of the plant <br>
a picture <br>
what type of plant <br>
light requirements <br>
watering routines <br>
</em>

Possible selectable calendar that tracks waterings and feedings.
